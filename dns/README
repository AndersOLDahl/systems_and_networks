For this DNS Client we decided to make a struct to hold all of our data logically.
Once this struct was setup correctly (with a SETUP one with default values hard-coded
in) we then push our packet together in the right format to dump and send_to

Our biggest challenge was the DNS pointers since they do not act the same as regular pointers.
We abstracted our struct a little to hold a pointer to an answer struct so that a multitude of answers
can be daisy chained onto it. Understanding how our structs then translated to the packets
was an implementation and design challenge.

We originally tried to take on the extra credit but we were short on time to implement it without
destroying our code.
